    the original triangles as a proxy for the edges between the faces
    (i.e., the edge of the triangle is the shared edge). We'll arbitrarily
    pick the triangle graph edge with lower-index start vertex.
    Also, to aid in traversing the implicit graph, we'll keep the left
    and right triangle triples with edge 'ER edge'.
